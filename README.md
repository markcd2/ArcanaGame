# ArcanaGame
An opensource 2D Fantasy Metroidvania videogame, Arcana, progremmed in Javascript/html.
This game is a work in progress, a high-fantasy themed metroidvania that utilizes Ai-art in order to create a wide variety of player characters, items, and enemies. It will be paired with a series of development log videos on youtube, channel link will be added here once the first few videos are uploaded. 
I wanted the game to be easily accessible and easy to progam and play on any machine... it is as simple as downloading the folders and opening up the HTML file in your browswer. 
The game is currently far from finished, but has a few procedurelly generated platform levels with simple enenmy AI. The basic combat, enemies, animations, and inventory system are implemented, but much more is to be added. An updated character upgrade system, combat, more enemies, bosses, level types, etc... will be added. Eventually the game will have 12 playable characters, currently only 4 are available. The game has about 6 types enemies and will eventually have much, much more. The game is going to be susceptible to scope creep, but hopefully a few others can get interested in the project and many hands make light work. Even if its just me, I thought i would share it and hopefully teach and inspire some aspiring game devs. 
Will check in on the project on weekends, add upgrades and tutorial links. Again, very open to suggestions and hope other find playing or working on the project fun.
